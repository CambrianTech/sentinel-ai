# Neural Plasticity Stress Protocols: Next Steps

This document outlines the current status of the stress protocols implementation and the recommended next steps.

## Implementation Status

We have successfully implemented:

1. **Task Suite System**:
   - Core `TaskSuite`, `TaskConfig`, and `TaskExample` classes
   - Three predefined task suites:
     - Diverse tasks (commonsense QA, summarization, code completion, NLI)
     - Memory stress tasks (long context recall, key-value memory)
     - Conflicting tasks (standard vs. reversed, literal vs. idiomatic)

2. **Task Alternation Protocol**:
   - Complete implementation of the `TaskAlternationProtocol` class
   - Metrics tracking for learning, forgetting, and recovery rates
   - Visualization tools for performance over time
   - Checkpoint saving and results management

3. **Runner Scripts**:
   - `run_stress_test_protocol.py` for multi-model stress testing
   - `test_task_alternation.py` for basic testing and verification
   - Visualization generator for comparative analysis

## Integration Status

The modules are integrated with the Sentinel-AI package structure:
- Added to `sentinel/plasticity/stress_protocols/`
- Updated imports in `sentinel/plasticity/__init__.py`
- Updated imports in `sentinel/__init__.py`
- Created documentation in `docs/stress_test_protocols.md`

## Current Issues

1. **Import Conflict**: There's a conflict between the Hugging Face datasets library and the `sentinel_data` module that's preventing the system from importing correctly. This needs to be resolved for the system to work properly.

2. **Transformers Dependency**: The current implementation relies on the Hugging Face Transformers library. We may need to create a more isolated version that can work with custom model implementations.

## Next Steps

### Immediate

1. **Fix Import Conflict**:
   - Investigate the conflict between `sentinel_data.table` and Hugging Face datasets
   - Either modify our import paths or create a compatibility layer
   - Consider using a custom fork of the datasets library if necessary

2. **Create a Simplified Version**:
   - Implement a version that doesn't rely on transformers for basic testing
   - Isolate the core functionality from external dependencies
   - Make a standalone module with minimal requirements

### Short-term

1. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test with the entropy journal to track attention patterns during task alternation
   - Test with function tracking to measure function preservation across tasks
   - Create comprehensive test cases for all components

2. **Add More Task Types**:
   - Implement task suites for mathematical reasoning
   - Add multilingual task suites for testing cross-lingual transfer
   - Create adversarial tasks to test robustness

3. **Enhance Visualization**:
   - Add interactive visualizations (e.g., with Plotly)
   - Create dashboard-style reports for experiment results
   - Add visualization for attention pattern changes during adaptation

### Medium-term

1. **RL Controller Integration**:
   - Connect the stress protocols to the RL controller
   - Allow the controller to optimize pruning strategies based on recovery rates
   - Implement adaptive difficulty based on model performance

2. **Advanced Analysis Tools**:
   - Add statistical testing for significance of results
   - Implement baseline comparisons (e.g., with random pruning)
   - Create longitudinal tracking for long-term experiments

3. **Publication Materials**:
   - Generate publication-quality figures and tables
   - Create benchmark datasets for standardized testing
   - Document methodologies and metrics for reproducible research

## Resource Requirements

1. **Development Resources**:
   - Engineering time to fix import conflicts
   - Testing time to verify integration with other modules
   - GPU resources for running full-scale tests

2. **Documentation Resources**:
   - Time to create comprehensive API documentation
   - Examples and tutorials for common use cases
   - Scientific methodology documentation for publication

## Timeline Estimates

1. **Import conflict resolution**: 1-2 days
2. **Basic functionality testing**: 2-3 days
3. **Integration with other modules**: 3-5 days
4. **Enhanced task suites**: 5-7 days
5. **Complete system with RL integration**: 2-3 weeks

## Conclusion

The stress protocols system is a powerful tool for studying neural plasticity in transformer models. With the current implementation, we're well on our way to creating a comprehensive framework for measuring adaptation capabilities. The immediate focus should be on resolving the import conflict and testing the basic functionality, after which we can proceed with deeper integration and enhanced capabilities.
