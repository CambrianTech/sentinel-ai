"""
Adaptive Transformer Implementation

This module provides the implementation of the AdaptiveCausalLmWrapper, 
which wraps transformer models with adaptive capabilities like per-head gating.

For backward compatibility, this initially imports from the legacy code path.
This will be replaced with a native implementation in the future.
