Llama Model Loader for Sentinel-AI

This module provides functions to load Llama models into the Sentinel-AI adaptive architecture.
It handles the initialization of the adaptive transformer from a pretrained Llama model.

This is a stub implementation for backward compatibility - will be fully implemented later.
