# Continuous Integration Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Sentinel AI project, with the goal of achieving close to 100% coverage of core code components. The test suite will be integrated into the CI pipeline to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

## Test Categories

The test suite is organized into the following categories:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between multiple components
3. **Colab Notebook Tests**: Verify structure and functionality of notebooks

## Components to Test

### Unit Tests

#### Core Components

- **AdaptiveOptimizer** ✅
  - Initialization
  - Model loading
  - Data preparation
  - Pruning strategy selection
  - Fine-tuning
  - Checkpointing

- **Pruning Strategies** ✅
  - Entropy-based pruning
  - Magnitude-based pruning
  - Random pruning (baseline)

- **Metrics Tracking** ✅
  - Progress tracking
  - Visualization
  - Reporting

- **Utilities** ✅
  - Data loading
  - Model utilities
  - Training helpers
  - Generation utilities

### Integration Tests

- **End-to-End Workflow**
  - Full optimization cycle
  - Multi-cycle optimization
  - Model pruning and recovery

- **Colab Integration**
  - Simplified API for colab
  - Colab-specific utilities

### Notebook Tests

- **Colab Notebooks** ✅
  - Verify structure
  - Validate imports
  - Check for critical functions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Unit Tests (Current) ✅

1. Set up test infrastructure
2. Implement tests for core components
3. Verify component isolation
4. Achieve >80% unit test coverage

### Phase 2: Integration Tests

1. Implement workflow tests
2. Test component interactions
3. Verify error handling and recovery
4. Test configuration and customization

### Phase 3: CI Integration

1. Set up GitHub Actions workflow
2. Configure test runners
3. Implement coverage reporting
4. Set up notification system

## Test Execution

Tests can be run using the provided `run_tests.py` script:

```bash
# Run all tests
python run_tests.py

# Run specific test category
python run_tests.py --category unit

# Run with coverage analysis
python run_tests.py --coverage --html-report
```

## Current Status

- Unit tests for core components have been implemented
- Basic integration tests for end-to-end workflow are in progress
- Notebook tests for critical colab functionality are implemented
- Some issues with matplotlib mocking in tests need to be resolved
- Need to fix the remaining test failures in the test suite

## Next Steps

1. Fix the remaining test failures in the metrics tracker and model utility tests
2. Implement more comprehensive integration tests
3. Set up the CI pipeline with GitHub Actions
4. Add coverage reporting to the CI workflow
5. Implement automatic test execution for PRs
