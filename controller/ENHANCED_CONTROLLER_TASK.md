# Enhanced ANN Controller with Feedback Learning

## Task Description
Implement a feedback-based reward system for the ANN controller to learn which pruning/growing patterns improve model performance during training and continue adapting during inference.

## Technical Approaches

### 1. Feedback Mechanism
- **Periodic Evaluation**: Every N batches (configurable), evaluate model performance on a validation set
- **Performance Metrics**: Track perplexity, loss, accuracy, and generation quality metrics
- **Reward Signal**: Calculate reward as improvement delta over previous performance
- **Moving Average**: Use exponential moving average to stabilize feedback signals

### 2. Controller Enhancement
- **Reinforcement Learning Integration**: 
  - Add policy gradient approach where the controller actions (gate adjustments) receive rewards
  - Implement PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) or A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) for more stable learning
- **Stateful History Tracking**:
  - Maintain memory of recent actions and their effects (last K decisions)
  - Include state transitions for different head patterns over time
- **Multi-objective Optimization**:
  - Balance computational efficiency (more pruning) vs performance (better metrics)
  - Implement Pareto optimization for multi-objective trade-offs

### 3. Implementation Timeline
1. **Phase 1: Basic Feedback Mechanism**
   - Implement batch-wise periodic evaluation
   - Add simple reward calculation based on validation loss improvement
   - Create basic RL policy gradient update for controller

2. **Phase 2: Enhanced Learning**
   - Add history tracking and state representation
   - Implement more sophisticated RL algorithms (PPO/A2C)
   - Add multi-objective optimization

3. **Phase 3: Continuous Adaptation**
   - Enable feedback learning during inference
   - Add lifelong learning capabilities
   - Implement meta-learning to transfer knowledge between tasks

## Implementation Details

### Feedback Timing
Two configurable approaches:
1. **Periodic Batch Feedback**: Evaluate and update every N batches
   - Advantages: Stable feedback, clear performance correlation
   - Disadvantages: Less frequent updates, higher overhead
   
2. **Continuous Reward Streaming**: Update online during training
   - Advantages: More responsive, faster adaptation
   - Disadvantages: Potentially noisy signal, might need stabilization

Default recommendation: Start with periodic batch feedback (every 50-100 batches) then experiment with continuous approaches.

### Reward Function
```python
def calculate_reward(current_metrics, previous_metrics, efficiency_factor):
    # Performance improvement component
    perf_improvement = previous_metrics["loss"] - current_metrics["loss"]
    
    # Efficiency component (reward higher pruning rates)
    efficiency = current_metrics["pruned_percentage"] * efficiency_factor
    
    # Combined reward with weighted components
    reward = perf_improvement + efficiency
    
    # Normalize reward to stable range
    reward = torch.tanh(reward)  # Keep between -1 and 1
    
    return reward
```

### Controller Updates
```python
class EnhancedController(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_layers, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        self.baseline = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1))
        self.learning_rate = 0.01
        self.gamma = 0.99  # Discount factor
        
        # History tracking
        self.action_history = []
        self.reward_history = []
        self.state_history = []
        
        # Original controller components
        # ...existing controller code...
    
    def update_policy(self, reward):
        # Policy gradient update
        policy_loss = []
        returns = []
        
        # Calculate returns with discount factor
        R = 0
        for r in reversed(self.reward_history):
            R = r + self.gamma * R
            returns.insert(0, R)
        
        returns = torch.tensor(returns)
        returns = (returns - returns.mean()) / (returns.std() + 1e-8)
        
        # Calculate policy gradient loss
        for log_prob, R in zip(self.action_history, returns):
            policy_loss.append(-log_prob * R)
        
        # Update controller parameters
        policy_loss = torch.stack(policy_loss).sum()
        policy_loss.backward()
        
        # Clear history after update
        self.action_history = []
        self.reward_history = []
        self.state_history = []
```

## Integration with Existing System

2. Extend controller with history tracking and reward processing
3. Modify gate update mechanism to record actions and probabilities

## Post-Training Adaptability

To enable continuous adaptation during inference:
1. Add online learning mode to controller
2. Implement inference-time feedback collection
3. Create lightweight adaptation without full backward pass
4. Add user feedback option for reinforcement signals

## Benefits

3. **Continual improvement**: Model continues to optimize itself during deployment
4. **Reduced manual tuning**: Less need for hand-crafted pruning approaches

## Evaluation Strategy

Evaluate the enhanced controller by:
1. Comparing against fixed pruning strategies
2. Measuring adaptation speed to new tasks
3. Analyzing emergent pruning patterns
4. Testing generalization to unseen tasks
5. Measuring resource efficiency vs performance trade-offs
