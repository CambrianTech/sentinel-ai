# PruningAndFineTuningColab Notebook Documentation

## Overview

This Colab notebook demonstrates making transformer language models (like GPT-2) both smaller and more powerful through a combination of pruning and fine-tuning techniques.

## Features (v0.0.31)

- Supports multiple model architectures (GPT-2, OPT)
- Implements three pruning strategies:
  - Random: Assigns random importance to heads
  - Magnitude: Uses L2 norm of weights for importance
  - Entropy: Measures attention entropy on validation data
- Provides real-time visualization of training progress
- Uses real-world Wikitext data for training
- Includes memory management features for Colab
- Supports CPU, GPU, and TPU environments
- Includes file download functionality for Colab

## Implementation Notes

- The pruning implementation uses a gating mechanism rather than actually removing heads
- This approach allows for easier recovery through fine-tuning
- Three pruning strategies are provided with "entropy" typically giving best results
- Optimal pruning level is usually around 30% (pruning_level=0.3)
- FP16 is used automatically on GPU for better memory efficiency

## Known Issues Fixed in v0.0.31

- Fixed `get_strategy()` parameter issue that was causing errors with Pythia models
- Fixed entropy strategy implementation to handle missing prompt parameter
- Improved memory management for large models in Colab environment
