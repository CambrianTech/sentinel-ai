# PruningAndFineTuningColab Notebook Documentation

## Overview

This Colab notebook demonstrates making transformer language models (like GPT-2) both smaller and more powerful through a combination of pruning and fine-tuning techniques.

## Features (v0.0.33)

- Supports multiple model architectures (GPT-2, OPT, Pythia)
- Implements three pruning strategies:
  - Random: Assigns random importance to heads
  - Magnitude: Uses L2 norm of weights for importance
  - Entropy: Measures attention entropy on validation data
- Provides real-time visualization of training progress with improved readability
- Uses real-world Wikitext data for training
- Includes memory management features for Colab
- Supports CPU, GPU, and TPU environments
- Includes file download functionality for Colab
- Robust CUDA error handling and recovery
- Advanced model compatibility detection and attribute handling

## Implementation Notes

- The pruning implementation uses a gating mechanism rather than actually removing heads
- This approach allows for easier recovery through fine-tuning
- Three pruning strategies are provided with "entropy" typically giving best results
- Optimal pruning level is usually around 30% (pruning_level=0.3)
- FP16 is used automatically on GPU for better memory efficiency
- Automatic CUDA error recovery ensures notebook continues even with memory issues

## Known Issues Fixed in v0.0.33

- Fixed overcrowded y-axis in head importance visualization making it unreadable
- Fixed blank first graph issue with initialization improvements
- Fixed "Layer X doesn't have expected attributes" warnings with better attribute detection
- Fixed CUDA errors during fine-tuning with comprehensive CPU fallback mechanisms
- Added memory monitoring with psutil to prevent out-of-memory issues
- Improved model compatibility across different architectures with nested attribute detection
- Enhanced visualization techniques for better readability with models that have many heads/layers
