This notebook has been updated with specific optimizations to run reliably on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) hardware. 

These optimizations include:
1. Forcing CPU usage even if CUDA is ostensibly available
2. Single-threaded BLAS operations to prevent crashes
3. Safe matrix multiplication with proper tensor management
4. Memory layout optimization with contiguous tensors
5. NaN/Inf value detection and handling

If you encounter any issues on Apple Silicon, try:
1. Using smaller batch sizes
2. Running smaller models
3. Adding more tensor validation checks

For Colab users, these optimizations are automatically disabled to maintain performance.""")
