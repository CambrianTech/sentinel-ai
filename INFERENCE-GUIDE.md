# Sentinel-AI: Inference Guide

This guide provides information on the current status of the Sentinel-AI model's inference capabilities and suggestions for improving coherent text generation.

## Current Status

1. **Weight Loading**: ✅ Successfully loads all parameters (1290/1290) from pretrained GPT-2 models
2. **Forward Pass**: ✅ Forward pass is working for both training and inference 
3. **U-Net Skip Connections**: ⚠️ Disabled for stability, can be gradually enabled
4. **Text Generation**: ⚠️ Working but with coherence issues

## Troubleshooting Text Generation

The model currently has issues generating coherent text, despite properly loading from pretrained GPT-2. Here are some approaches to address this:

### 1. Fine-tuning

Even with perfect weight initialization, the Adaptive Transformer architecture introduces changes that require adaptation:

```bash
# Run a short fine-tuning (1-2 epochs) to adapt the loaded weights
python train.py --model_name=gpt2 --num_epochs=2 --batch_size=4 --learning_rate=5e-5
```

### 2. Disable Model Features

For testing, try disabling adaptive features one by one:

```bash
# Disable features in models/adaptive_transformer.py:
# 1. Comment out the U-Net skip connections (already done)
# 2. Set all gate values to 1.0 (disable sentinel gates temporarily)
# 3. Remove the logit scaling and boost/penalty systems
```

### 3. Generation Parameters

Try different generation parameters:

```bash
# Greedy decoding instead of sampling
python main.py --prompt "Your text" --temperature 0.0 --top_k 1

# Higher diversity 
python main.py --prompt "Your text" --temperature 1.0 --top_p 0.95
```

### 4. Attention Mechanism

Review the attention implementation, especially:

1. The scaling factor in the attention mechanism (`self.scale = 1.0 / math.sqrt(self.head_dim)`)
2. The interaction between the gate parameter and the attention output
3. The initialization of QKV matrices

### 5. Debug Tools

Visualize model internals:

```bash
# Run the attention visualization notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/AdaptiveAttentionVisualization.ipynb

# Track gate values during generation
python main.py --prompt "Your text" --track_gate_values
```

## Next Steps

1. **Debugging Generation**: Start with the simplest configuration (all gates = 1.0, disabled U-Net) to isolate issues
2. **Fine-tuning**: A short fine-tuning run may help the model adapt to its new architecture
3. **Metric Collection**: Implement logging of entropy, head importance metrics in training.py
4. **Controller**: Once text generation is working well, enable the controller for dynamic architecture management

Remember that the Sentinel-AI architecture introduces significant changes to the standard transformer, so expect some adaptation time even with proper weight initialization.
