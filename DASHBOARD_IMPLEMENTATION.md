# Neural Plasticity Dashboard Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the Neural Plasticity Dashboard, a comprehensive visualization system for tracking and analyzing neural plasticity experiments in real-time.

Version: v0.0.1 (2025-04-20)

## Key Features

1. **Real-time Experiment Monitoring**:
   - Track experiment progress while it's running
   - View key metrics, phases, and decisions in real-time
   - Monitor console output with formatted information

2. **Comprehensive Visualizations**:
   - Warmup phase: Training loss curves and stabilization detection
   - Analysis phase: Entropy and gradient heatmaps for attention heads
   - Pruning phase: Before/after architecture visualization
   - Evaluation phase: Direct comparison of baseline vs. pruned models

3. **Multiple Dashboard Options**:
   - Weights & Biases integration for online tracking
   - Standalone HTML dashboard for offline viewing
   - Real-time console output for immediate feedback

4. **Collaboration Features**:
   - Shareable dashboard links for team analysis
   - Browser integration for automatic dashboard opening
   - Support for both local and Colab environments

## Implementation Components

### 1. Core Dashboard Integration

The `WandbDashboard` class in `utils/neural_plasticity/dashboard/wandb_integration.py` provides:
- Integration with Weights & Biases for experiment tracking
- Support for both online and offline modes
- Comprehensive logging of metrics, visualizations, and text samples
- Real-time console output for all experiment phases

### 2. Experiment Phase Visualizations

#### Warmup Phase
- Loss curve visualization with smoothed trend line
- Training metric tracking (loss, perplexity)
- Text samples during training

#### Analysis Phase
- Entropy heatmap for attention heads
- Gradient heatmap for attention heads
- Combined importance metrics visualization

#### Pruning Phase
- Pruning decision visualization
- Before/after model architecture comparison
- Pruned heads highlighted by layer

#### Evaluation Phase
- Side-by-side text generation comparison
- Perplexity comparison bar charts
- Attention pattern visualization

### 3. Standalone Dashboard Demo

The `dashboard_demo.py` script provides:
- Complete mock experiment simulation for testing
- Generation of all visualizations without running a full experiment
- Exportable HTML dashboard with embedded visualizations
- Browser integration for easy viewing

### 4. Colab Integration

The `colab_integration.py` module provides:
- Specialized support for Google Colab environments
- Integration with Colab's display system
- Sharing options for collaborative analysis
- Support for tunneling for local servers

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Dashboard Demo

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run offline demo (creates local dashboard)
python -m utils.neural_plasticity.dashboard.dashboard_demo

# Run online demo (publishes to wandb.ai)
WANDB_MODE=online python -m utils.neural_plasticity.dashboard.dashboard_demo --online
```

### Running a Full Experiment with Dashboard

```bash
# Run experiment with dashboard enabled
python scripts/run_neural_plasticity.py --model_name distilgpt2 --pruning_strategy entropy --pruning_level 0.2 --use_dashboard

# For quick testing
python scripts/run_neural_plasticity.py --model_name distilgpt2 --quick_test --use_dashboard
```

### Viewing the Dashboard

1. **Online Mode**: Dashboard URL will be provided in console output, or:
   ```
   open https://wandb.ai/[username]/neural-plasticity/runs/[run_id]
   ```

2. **Offline Mode**: Open the local HTML file:
   ```
   open output/neural_plasticity_[timestamp]/dashboard.html
   ```

3. **Colab Environment**: Click the dashboard link displayed in the notebook cell.

## Implementation Details

### Metrics Tracking

The dashboard tracks key metrics:
- Training and evaluation loss
- Perplexity
- Sparsity (percentage of pruned heads)
- Inference speedup
- Model size reduction

### Visualization Methods

1. **Heatmaps**: For entropy, gradients, and attention patterns
2. **Line Charts**: For loss curves and performance tracking
3. **Bar Charts**: For perplexity and other comparative metrics
4. **Grid Visualizations**: For model architecture and pruning decisions
5. **Text Samples**: For qualitative evaluation of model outputs

### Callback System

The dashboard provides callback functions for the experiment:
1. `metrics_callback`: For logging all numeric metrics
2. `sample_callback`: For logging text generation samples

## Next Steps

1. **Multi-Cycle Tracking**: Enhance the dashboard to track multiple pruning cycles
2. **Fine-Tuning Visualization**: Add visualizations for the fine-tuning phase
3. **Attention Evolution**: Track how attention patterns evolve across pruning cycles
4. **Model Growth**: Visualize neural plasticity with model growth

## Conclusion

The Neural Plasticity Dashboard provides a comprehensive visualization system for tracking, analyzing, and sharing neural plasticity experiments. It supports real-time monitoring, detailed phase visualization, and collaborative analysis through multiple viewing options.
