# Neural Plasticity Implementation Roadmap

## Current Implementation Status

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive neural plasticity experiment system with:

1. **Complete End-to-End Experiment Flow**
   - Warmup phase detection with stabilization point identification
   - Multiple pruning events based on head importance metrics
   - Growing/cloning of heads for optimal model structure
   - Fine-tuning with continuous performance tracking

2. **Comprehensive Visualization Dashboard**
   - Main visualization showing the entire training process
   - Clear marking of all phase transitions (warmup end, pruning events, fine-tuning)
   - Detailed visualizations of model perplexity, sparsity, and head activity
   - Entropy and gradient heatmaps showing pruning decision factors
   - Activity timeline showing the complete history of each attention head

3. **Interactive HTML Report**
   - Tab-based interface for different aspects of the experiment
   - Event log showing all pruning and growing events
   - Detailed performance impact analysis
   - Head activity visualization across all layers
   - Chronological event tracking with performance impact metrics

4. **Cross-Environment Compatibility**
   - Fully functional in both local and Colab environments
   - Data portability between environments
   - Consistent visualization and reporting

## Missing Features (Based on Reference Materials)

Comparing with the reference materials, we need to add:

1. **Text Generation/Inference After Each Pruning Event** 
   - Generate sample text after pruning to show model capabilities
   - Track and visualize quality of generated text across the experiment

2. **More Prominent Phase Labels in Main Visualization**
   - Add clear text labels for each phase in the main visualization
   - Include phase-specific background colors as in the reference graph

3. **Model Structure Details**
   - Add detailed visualization of model architecture before and after pruning
   - Show specific attention patterns in pruned vs. retained heads

4. **Fine-Tuning Details**
   - Add more detailed metrics specific to the fine-tuning phase
   - Show recovery curve with respect to the original performance

5. **Interpolated Load Testing**
   - Ability to load experiment data from any snapshot point
   - "Time travel" to any point in the experiment to continue from there

## Enhancement Roadmap
