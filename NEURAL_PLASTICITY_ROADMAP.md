## Current Status and Next Steps (2025-04-20)

### Current Implementation Status

1. **Decision Visualization Features Implemented**
   - Comprehensive visualizations showing pruning/growing criteria added to the HTML report
   - JSON export of decision metrics for transparency
   - Modal popups for high-resolution decision visualizations
   - Visualization gallery in HTML report showing all decision points

2. **Implementation Issues Identified**
   - The run_dynamic_plasticity_experiment.py script uses hardcoded values rather than real model training
   - It simulates loss patterns and pruning decisions rather than using real models and data
   - We need to implement a real system that actually loads and runs models and datasets

3. **Real Implementation Requirements**
   - Found candidates in utils/neural_plasticity/experiment.py and training.py modules
   - These appear to have real model loading and training code
   - Need to create a comprehensive script that runs the full experiment

### Next Steps (Immediate Priority)

1. **Create Complete Experiment Runner**
   - Create a script that uses the real neural_plasticity modules
   - Ensure it loads real models and datasets from HuggingFace
   - Make sure it processes real data and calculates real entropy/gradient values
   - Implement real pruning of model weights
   - Run the full process with warmup → pruning → recovery → fine-tuning

2. **Test End-to-End Locally First**
   - Run the complete experiment locally with a small model
   - Ensure all phases work with real data
   - Validate that the decision visualizations show real model metrics
   - Generate and examine a complete HTML report

3. **Prepare for T4 GPU Deployment**
   - Ensure the same code works in both local and Colab environments
   - Make necessary adaptations for GPU vs CPU processing
   - Test with datasets of appropriate size for T4 GPU

### Implementation Requirements (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Real Model Processing** 
   - Must use real models from HuggingFace, not simulated data
   - Must download and process real datasets
   - Must perform real forward and backward passes
   - Must calculate entropy from actual attention patterns
   - Must prune real model weights

2. **Real-Time Evaluation**
   - Must generate text samples from the model at each phase
   - Must evaluate model performance with real metrics
   - Must show stabilization based on actual loss values, not simulated patterns

3. **Comprehensive Visualization**
   - Must visualize the actual decision process with real model metrics
   - Must create complete HTML reports documenting the entire process
   - Must make all visualizations available in both local and Colab environments

### Phase 2: Advanced Analytics & Portability
