# Agency Model Enhancement Plan

## 1. Performance Optimizations

### Critical Issues
- **Sequential Head Processing**: The current implementation processes each attention head in a for-loop, making it ~10x slower than the baseline model
- **Redundant Tensor Operations**: Multiple small tensor allocations and copies
- **Excessive Agency Checks**: The ethical AI checking adds significant overhead for every head

### Proposed Solutions
1. **Batched Head Processing**:
   - Rewrite attention computation to process all heads simultaneously
   - Use batched matrix operations instead of loops
   - Keep gate effects by using broadcasted multiplications

2. **Fused Tensor Operations**:
   - Combine Q/K/V projections into a single batched operation
   - Pre-allocate tensors for outputs to reduce memory allocations
   - Use in-place operations where possible

3. **Optimized Agency Checking**:
   - Move ethicality checks to a pre-processing step
   - Use binary masks for consent/withdrawal states
   - Apply masks as tensor operations rather than conditional branches

4. **CUDA Optimizations**:
   - Add custom CUDA kernels for critical operations
   - Use torch.compile() (if PyTorch 2.0+) for JIT fusion
   - Implement operation fusion for QKV projections

## 2. UNet Baseline Integration

### Current State
- Agency model has U-Net style skip connections between its own encoder/decoder layers
- Baseline model is loaded but only used for comparison metrics

### Proposed Enhancements
1. **Baseline-Agency Connection**:
   - Add cross-connections from baseline model hidden states to agency model
   - Use baseline representations to inform agency decisions
   - Create alignment mechanism between baseline and agency attention patterns

2. **Knowledge Distillation**:
   - Use baseline outputs as soft targets for agency heads
   - Implement dynamic distillation using similarity metrics
   - Create a feedback loop for agency decisions based on baseline performance

3. **Hybrid Operation Mode**:
   - Allow dynamic switching between baseline and agency components
   - Create a mixed inference mode that leverages both models
   - Implement a performance-based routing mechanism

## 3. Model Quality Improvements

### Current Issues
- Agency model has worse perplexity than baseline (~34 vs ~26)
- Quality-speed tradeoff is unfavorable at low pruning levels

### Proposed Solutions
1. **Improved Initialization**:
   - Better initialization of gate parameters
   - Improved adaptation of weights from baseline
   - Progressive activation of agency mechanisms

2. **Training Enhancements**:
   - Add specialized training regime for agency components
   - Implement curriculum learning for pruning levels
   - Create adversarial loss function for agency robustness

3. **Adaptive Metrics**:
   - Add runtime quality monitoring
   - Implement dynamic threshold adjustment
   - Create context-aware agency signals

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Phase 1: Performance Optimizations** (Highest Priority)
   - Batched head processing
   - Tensor operation fusion
   - Agency checking optimization

2. **Phase 2: UNet Baseline Integration**
   - Baseline-agency connections
   - Knowledge distillation framework
   - Cross-model attention mechanisms

3. **Phase 3: Quality Improvements**
   - Improved initialization strategies
   - Progressive activation scheme
   - Training enhancements

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Speed Target**: Achieve at least 50% of baseline speed
- **Quality Target**: Maintain perplexity within 15% of baseline at 0% pruning
- **Pruning Effectiveness**: Demonstrate superior quality retention at 50%+ pruning levels
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reduced memory footprint for agency model
