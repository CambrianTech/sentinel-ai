# Sentinel AI Repository Reorganization

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive reorganization of the Sentinel AI codebase that was implemented to improve code organization, maintainability, and collaboration.

## Goals

The reorganization had the following goals:

1. Create a proper Python package structure with `sentinel` as the root package
2. Organize modules by functionality (models, controller, pruning, etc.)
3. Ensure backward compatibility during the transition
4. Standardize import paths and module organization
5. Make the package installable via pip
6. Provide entry points for main scripts
7. Enable perfect collaboration on both local and Colab environments

## New Structure

The new project structure is organized as follows:

```

│   ├── __init__.py             # Package initialization

├── main.py                     # Main entry point (legacy)
└── train.py                    # Training script (legacy)
```

## Migration Strategy

The reorganization was implemented using the following strategy:

1. Create the new directory structure with appropriate `__init__.py` files
2. Move files to their new locations in the `sentinel` package
3. Update import paths in the moved files
4. Create backward-compatible stubs at the original locations
5. Fix circular import issues and improve module dependencies
6. Test functionality to ensure nothing was broken
7. Create a setup.py file for package installation
8. Create entry points for main scripts

## Backward Compatibility

To maintain backward compatibility during and after the transition, stub files were created at the original locations of moved files. These stubs import from the new locations and issue deprecation warnings when used.

Example of a stub file:

```python
"""
DEPRECATED: This module has moved to sentinel.models.loaders.loader
This import stub will be removed in a future version.
"""
import warnings
warnings.warn(
    "Importing from models.loaders.loader is deprecated. "
    "Use sentinel.models.loaders.loader instead.",
    DeprecationWarning, 
    stacklevel=2
)

from sentinel.models.loaders.loader import *
```

## Installation

The package can now be installed using pip:

```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Regular installation
pip install .
```

## Entry Points

The following command-line entry points are available after installation:

- `sentinel-train` - Run the training script
- `sentinel-inference` - Run the inference script
- `sentinel-prune` - Run the pruning script
- `sentinel-benchmark` - Run the benchmarking script

## Next Steps

The following steps are recommended to further improve the codebase:

1. Increase test coverage (currently at ~5%)
2. Update all documentation to reflect the new structure
3. Refactor imports in notebooks to use the new paths
4. Add type hints and improve docstrings
5. Implement CI/CD for automated testing and deployment
