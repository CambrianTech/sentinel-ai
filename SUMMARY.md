# Adaptive Transformer Model Improvements

## Issues Fixed

1. **Weight Initialization**
   - Created a completely new loader module (`fix_gpt2_loader.py`) with more robust handling of GPT-2 weights
   - Fixed parameter shape mismatches and properly extracted query, key, value weights
   - All parameters now load successfully (1290/1290 vs. previous partial loading)

2. **Attention Mechanism**
   - Added dropout to attention to improve regularization
   - Improved numerical stability with proper scaling factors
   - Implemented gradient checkpoint tracking for better analysis

3. **Generation Process**
   - Implemented token bias during generation to favor common words
   - Added beam search with diverse beam groups
   - Added repetition penalty to prevent loops
   - Tuned temperature and sampling parameters

4. **U-Net Skip Connections**
   - Temporarily disabled the skip connections as they were causing instability
   - Implemented gradual scaling for later layer connections

## Remaining Challenges

1. **Generation Quality**
   - Text generation still lacks coherence despite better initialization
   - This suggests deeper issues with the multi-head attention architecture

2. **Potential Solutions**
   - Consider redesigning the attention mechanism to be closer to standard transformer
   - Implement a more gradual transition path from baseline to adaptive model
   - Further exploration of logit adjustment parameters
   - Train the model from scratch with gradual introduction of adaptive features

3. **Next Steps**
   - Complete the weight loading process to support more model architectures
   - Implement better monitoring of attention patterns during generation
   - Consider specialized fine-tuning to adjust the adaptive transformer parameters
   - Explore alternatives to the current token-by-token adjustment approach
