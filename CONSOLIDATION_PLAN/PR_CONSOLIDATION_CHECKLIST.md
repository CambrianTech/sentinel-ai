## Planned Consolidations

1. **Visualization Code**:

   - Remove duplicate code in utils/neural_plasticity/visualization.py
   - Create proper visualization tests

2. **Notebook Integration**:
   - Consolidate all notebook utilities to `scripts/neural_plasticity/colab/`
   - Update notebooks to use the consolidated implementation
   - Test notebook functionality in both CPU and GPU environments

3. **Redundant Implementations**:
   - Consolidate utils/neural_plasticity/ and sentinel/plasticity/ implementations
   - Make sentinel/plasticity/ the primary implementation
   - Update all references to use the consolidated code

4. **Test Coverage**:
   - Add comprehensive tests for core functionality
   - Add tests for Colab integration
   - Add tests for cross-platform compatibility
   - Add tests for visualization

## Open Questions

1. Should we maintain backward compatibility with existing notebooks after consolidation?
2. How should we handle environment-specific code (Apple Silicon, GPU, Colab)?
3. Should we create a unified config system for all neural plasticity experiments?
