## Completed Steps

1. ✅ Removed all temp_fix/* files
2. ✅ Removed redundant scripts at repository root
3. ✅ Removed redundant test files that are superseded by the modular implementation 
4. ✅ Created a clean modular implementation in scripts/neural_plasticity/
5. ✅ Created proper tests for the modular implementation
6. ✅ Removed scripts/neural_plasticity_*.py files
7. ✅ Removed scripts/*plasticity*.py files
8. ✅ Removed test_*.py files from repository root
9. ✅ Removed additional utility scripts from repository root
10. ✅ Reduced the PR from 270+ files to ~160 files

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Implement consolidated output directory structure in `experiment_output/`
2. ✅ Update documentation to reflect the new organization
3. ✅ Add proper tests for the neural plasticity module
4. ✅ Complete a quick test to verify functionality
5. Run a full test with real data (pending)

## Open Questions

1. Should we move all visualization code to scripts/neural_plasticity/visualization/?
2. Should we consolidate all notebook-related utilities to a single location?
3. Are there any interdependencies we need to be careful about when removing files?
