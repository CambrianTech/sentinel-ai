# Files to remove (outdated/duplicate versions)

- dashboard_demo.py - Already committed properly as utils/neural_plasticity/dashboard/dashboard_demo.py
- run_demo_experiment.py - Earlier test version
- run_simple_experiment.py - Earlier test version

These files were created during development but have been superseded by the properly organized versions in the utils/neural_plasticity/dashboard/ directory.

Note: This file is itself temporary and can be deleted after cleanup.
