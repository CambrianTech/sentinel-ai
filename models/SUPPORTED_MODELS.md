# Supported Model Architectures

This document details the current support status for different model architectures in Sentinel-AI. The framework can load and adapt various transformer models, but compatibility and behavior may vary.

## Support Status Overview

| Family | Architecture | Example Models | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------------|----------------|--------|-------|
| **GPT-2** | Decoder-only | distilgpt2, gpt2, gpt2-medium | ✅ Full Support | Thoroughly tested and optimized |
| **OPT** | Decoder-only | facebook/opt-125m | ⚠️ Partial Support | Basic models work, larger ones may have issues |
| **Pythia/GPT-NeoX** | Decoder-only | EleutherAI/pythia-70m, pythia-160m | ✅ Full Support | Successfully loaded and tested |
| **BLOOM** | Decoder-only | bigscience/bloom-560m | ✅ Full Support | Successfully loaded and tested |
| **Llama** | Decoder-only | meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf | ⚠️ Limited Support | Requires HF token, not fully tested |

## Detailed Status by Family

### GPT-2 Family

| Model | Loading | Inference | Quality | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| distilgpt2 | ✅ | ✅ | Good | Coherent outputs, all parameters loaded correctly |
| gpt2 | ✅ | ✅ | Good | Coherent outputs, all parameters loaded correctly |
| gpt2-medium | ✅ | ✅ | Good | Coherent outputs, all parameters loaded correctly |
| gpt2-large | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Unknown | Should work but not thoroughly tested |
| gpt2-xl | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Unknown | Should work but not thoroughly tested |

### OPT Family

| Model | Loading | Inference | Quality | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| facebook/opt-125m | ✅ | ✅ | Fair | Outputs are less coherent but functional |
| facebook/opt-350m | ✅ | ❌ | N/A | Loads weights but fails during inference with tensor dimension mismatch |
| facebook/opt-1.3b | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Unknown | Not thoroughly tested |
| Larger models | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Unknown | Not thoroughly tested |

**Known Issues:**
- OPT-350m and larger models: Tensor size mismatch during inference
- OPT models use a different position embedding scheme which may cause issues

### Pythia/GPT-NeoX Family

| Model | Loading | Inference | Quality | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| EleutherAI/pythia-70m | ✅ | ✅ | Fair | Less coherent outputs but runs successfully |
| EleutherAI/pythia-160m | ✅ | ✅ | Fair | Less coherent outputs but runs successfully |
| EleutherAI/pythia-410m | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Unknown | Not thoroughly tested |
| Larger models | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Unknown | Not thoroughly tested |

**Notes:**
- The Pythia family handles weight loading correctly
- Output quality may require adjustment of generation parameters

### BLOOM Family

| Model | Loading | Inference | Quality | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| bigscience/bloom-560m | ✅ | ✅ | Mixed | Outputs contain mixed script text (multilingual) |
| bigscience/bloom-1b1 | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Unknown | Not thoroughly tested |
| Larger models | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Unknown | Not thoroughly tested |

**Notes:**
- BLOOM uses ALiBi positional attention (no explicit position embeddings)
- Position embeddings are created as needed during loading
- Multilingual model produces mixed script output by design

### Llama Family

| Model | Loading | Inference | Quality | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Unknown | Requires HuggingFace access token, not fully tested |

**Notes:**
- Llama models require authentication with the HuggingFace API
- Support is implemented but not thoroughly tested due to access requirements
- Llama uses SwiGLU activation and rotary position encoding which our loader handles

## Sample Outputs

Below are example outputs from each supported model family when prompted with the same input:

## Usage Examples

Here's how to use different model architectures with Sentinel-AI:

```python
import torch
from models.loaders.loader import load_baseline_model, load_adaptive_model

# Load a GPT-2 model
baseline_model = load_baseline_model("distilgpt2", "cpu")
adaptive_model = load_adaptive_model("distilgpt2", baseline_model, "cpu")

# Load an OPT model
baseline_model = load_baseline_model("facebook/opt-125m", "cpu")
adaptive_model = load_adaptive_model("facebook/opt-125m", baseline_model, "cpu")

# Load a Pythia model
baseline_model = load_baseline_model("EleutherAI/pythia-70m", "cpu")
adaptive_model = load_adaptive_model("EleutherAI/pythia-70m", baseline_model, "cpu")

# Load a BLOOM model
baseline_model = load_baseline_model("bigscience/bloom-560m", "cpu")
adaptive_model = load_adaptive_model("bigscience/bloom-560m", baseline_model, "cpu")
```

## Command Line Usage

To use these models from the command line:

```bash
# GPT-2
python main.py --model_name distilgpt2 --prompt "Your prompt here"

# OPT
python main.py --model_name facebook/opt-125m --prompt "Your prompt here"

# Pythia
python main.py --model_name EleutherAI/pythia-70m --prompt "Your prompt here"

# BLOOM
python main.py --model_name bigscience/bloom-560m --prompt "Your prompt here"
```

## Technical Details

### Architecture-Specific Handling

Each model family requires specific weight mapping and configuration handling:

1. **GPT-2**: Uses combined QKV projection, requires transformation into per-head format
2. **OPT**: Uses separate Q, K, V projections, needs careful position embedding handling
3. **Pythia/GPT-NeoX**: Some variants use combined QKV, others separate; loader handles both
4. **BLOOM**: Uses ALiBi attention instead of position embeddings, requires creating new position embeddings
5. **Llama**: Uses rotary position embeddings and SwiGLU activation, requires special handling

## Ongoing Improvements

We're actively working to improve multi-model support:

1. Fix tensor dimension issues in larger OPT models
2. Improve generation parameter settings for each model family
3. Add support for more model families (T5, BART, etc.)
4. Optimize loading process for faster initialization

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter issues with specific models, please report them in our issue tracker with:
1. Model name/version
2. Error message or unexpected behavior
3. Script or code used to reproduce the issue
