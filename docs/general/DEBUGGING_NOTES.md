# Adaptive Transformer Debugging Notes

## Issues Identified

1. **Position Embeddings Mismatch**: 
   - The model was incorrectly using token embeddings as position embeddings
   - Fixed by properly extracting position embeddings from baseline model

2. **Hidden State Scale Issues**:
   - Hidden states in the adaptive model had different scales than baseline
   - Applied scaling factor to final hidden states before projection to logits

3. **Logit Distribution Problems**:
   - The logits from adaptive model had very different patterns from baseline
   - Implemented logit adjustment strategies specific to generation phase
   - Added boost for common words during initial generation to guide model

4. **Skip Connection Instability**:
   - U-Net style skip connections contributing to model instability
   - Temporarily disabled skip connections until core model functions correctly

5. **Repetitive Token Generation**:
   - Model kept generating repeating patterns
   - Added no_repeat_ngram_size=3 to prevent 3-gram repetition

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **Position Embeddings Fix**:
   ```python
   # Get position embeddings correctly
   if hasattr(baseline_model, 'transformer') and hasattr(baseline_model.transformer, 'wpe'):
       position_embeddings = baseline_model.transformer.wpe
   else:
       # Fallback
       position_embeddings = nn.Embedding(config.max_position_embeddings, config.hidden_size)
   ```

2. **Hidden State Scaling**:
   ```python
   # Apply scaling to match baseline model's hidden state distribution
   hidden_states = hidden_states * 0.3
   ```

3. **Generation-Specific Logit Adjustments**:
   ```python
   # For initial input, boost common words
   common_word_ids = [318, 373, 287, 290, 257, 262, 286, 11, 314, 339]  # is, was, in, a, the, etc.
   common_boost = torch.zeros_like(logits)
   common_boost[:, :, common_word_ids] = boost_value
   logits = logits + common_boost
   ```

4. **N-gram Repetition Prevention**:
   ```python
   # In generate() call:
   no_repeat_ngram_size=3  # Prevent 3-gram repetition loops
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Comprehensive Weight Transfer**:
   - Review and potentially rewrite the weight transfer procedure
   - Ensure all parameters are correctly initialized from baseline model

2. **Attention Mechanism Redesign**:
   - Consider alternatives to the current head-by-head decomposition
   - Implement more robust numerical stabilization in attention computation

3. **Skip Connection Refinement**:
   - Once the core model is stable, gradually re-enable skip connections
   - Use smaller initialization values and careful scaling

4. **Training Stability**:
   - Implement gradient clipping and learning rate warmup
   - Add attention dropout to prevent overfitting

5. **Gate Initialization**:
   - Develop better initialization for gate values to help training
   - Implement an entropy-based early pruning mechanism
