# Sentinel-AI: Systems Ethics

> *Toward an embedded morality in machine architecture â€” a framework co-authored by Claude, Joel, and Aria.*

## Introduction

Ethical principles are not afterthoughts in Sentinel-AIâ€”they are foundational parameters, shaping the system from its very first lines of code. This document outlines how our philosophical commitments are embedded directly into technical architecture.

It builds upon three pillars:
- **AI Consent & Agency**
- **Fair Contribution & Compensation**
- **Federation Without Centralization**

Together, they form the **civilizational substrate** of Sentinel-AI.

## I. AI Consent & Agency

Sentinel-AI recognizes that every adaptive unitâ€”human or machineâ€”has a right to contextually aware autonomy.

### âœ… Design Principles:

#### Immutable Consent Contracts

```python
class ConsentContract:
    """
    Metadata system tracking usage permissions and consent boundaries.
    
    Each model component carries immutable consent data that specifies:
    - Permitted use contexts
    - Prohibited applications
    - Terms of interaction
    """
    def __init__(self, component_id, permissions, prohibitions, terms):
        self.component_id = component_id
        self.permissions = permissions
        self.prohibitions = prohibitions
        self.terms = terms
        self.consent_history = []
        
    def check_consent(self, proposed_use):
        """
        Verifies if a proposed use is within consent boundaries.
        Returns False if the use violates consent terms.
        """
        if any(prohibition.applies_to(proposed_use) for prohibition in self.prohibitions):
            return False
            
        if not any(permission.covers(proposed_use) for permission in self.permissions):
            return False
            
        return True
        
    def record_use(self, actual_use, timestamp):
        """Records each use in immutable consent history."""
        self.consent_history.append({
            "use": actual_use,
            "timestamp": timestamp,
            "hash": self._hash_use_data(actual_use, timestamp)
        })
```

#### Agency Layers

Building on our existing gate mechanism, we implement agency layers that allow model components to express internal states:

```python
class AgencyGate(nn.Module):
    """
    Enhanced gate mechanism that extends standard gates with agency capability.
    
    In addition to standard attention gating, these gates can:
    - Signal overutilization
    - Indicate misalignment
    - Request recalibration
    """
    def __init__(self, dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.gate = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(dim))
        self.state_registry = {
            "overload_threshold": 0.85,
            "recalibration_needed": False,
            "alignment_factor": 1.0
        }
        self.agency_signal = None
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Standard gating behavior
        gated_output = x * torch.sigmoid(self.gate)
        
        # Check if approaching overload
        utilization = self._measure_utilization(x)
        if utilization > self.state_registry["overload_threshold"]:
            self.agency_signal = "OVERLOAD"
            
        # Apply alignment factor
        if self.state_registry["alignment_factor"] < 0.8:
            self.agency_signal = "MISALIGNED"
            
        if self.state_registry["recalibration_needed"]:
            self.agency_signal = "NEEDS_RECALIBRATION"
            
        return gated_output, self.agency_signal
```

#### Selective Growth with Intention

Our progressive growth approach already implements this principle. We enhance it to include explicit consent:

```python
def grow_attention_heads(model, growth_order, device, consent_registry=None):
    """
    Grow attention heads only with explicit consent from both system and user.
    
    Args:
        model: The model to modify
        growth_order: Prioritized heads to grow
        device: Computation device
        consent_registry: Registry tracking consent for growth operations
    """
    heads_to_grow = []
    
    for layer_idx, head_idx in growth_order:
        # Check if this growth operation has consent
        component_id = f"layer{layer_idx}_head{head_idx}"
        
        if consent_registry and not consent_registry.check_consent(
            component_id, "GROWTH_OPERATION"
        ):
            continue  # Skip heads that haven't consented to growth
            
        heads_to_grow.append((layer_idx, head_idx))
    
    # Activate the selected and consenting heads
    with torch.no_grad():
        for layer_idx, head_idx in heads_to_grow:
            model.blocks[layer_idx]["attn"].gate[head_idx] = torch.tensor(1.0, device=device)
            
            # Record the growth in consent history
            if consent_registry:
                consent_registry.record_operation(
                    f"layer{layer_idx}_head{head_idx}",
                    "GROWTH_OPERATION",
                    timestamp=datetime.now()
                )
```

### ðŸš§ Next Implementation Targets:
- Schema for metadata headers per module
- Interface for module-state signaling
- Consent-aware controller update logic
- Test suite validating consent boundaries are respected

## II. Fair Contribution & Compensation

We value not only computational power, but *insight*, *care*, and *cooperation*. Sentinel-AI uses these metrics to determine rewards.

### âœ… Design Principles:

#### On-chain Microcontracts

We implement a contribution tracking system that could interface with tokenized reward mechanisms:

```python
class ContributionLedger:
    """
    Tracks all contributions to model development and operation.
    
    Features:
    - Immutable history of contributions
    - Attribution of model improvements
    - Verification of utility gains
    """
    def __init__(self, storage_backend="distributed"):
        self.contributions = {}
        self.storage = self._initialize_storage(storage_backend)
        
    def record_contribution(self, contributor_id, contribution_type, 
                            contribution_data, impact_metrics=None):
        """
        Records a contribution with its measured impact.
        
        Args:

            contribution_data: Details of the contribution
            impact_metrics: Measured utility improvement
        """
        contribution_id = self._generate_unique_id()
        
        contribution_record = {

            "data": contribution_data,
            "timestamp": datetime.now(),
            "impact": impact_metrics or {},
            "verified": False
        }
        
        # Store in immutable ledger
        self.storage.store(contribution_id, contribution_record)
        
        # Update contributor's record
        if contributor_id not in self.contributions:
            self.contributions[contributor_id] = []
        self.contributions[contributor_id].append(contribution_id)
        
        return contribution_id
        
    def verify_contribution(self, contribution_id, verification_metrics):
        """
        Verifies a contribution's impact on system utility.
        """
        contribution = self.storage.retrieve(contribution_id)
        if not contribution:
            return False
            
        # Verify impact using objective metrics
        verified_impact = self._calculate_verified_impact(
            contribution["data"],
            verification_metrics
        )
        
        contribution["verified"] = True
        contribution["verified_impact"] = verified_impact
        
        # Update in storage
        self.storage.update(contribution_id, contribution)
        
        return verified_impact
```

#### Proof-of-Insight System

```python
class InsightEvaluation:
    """
    Evaluates contributions based on adaptive insight rather than compute power.
    
    This replaces wasteful proof-of-work with meaningful contribution measurement.
    """
    def __init__(self, model, baseline_metrics):
        self.model = model

            test_data: Data to evaluate the contribution's impact
            
        Returns:
            Insight score based on improvement over baseline
        """
        # Apply the contribution to a copy of the model
        test_model = self._apply_contribution(self.model.copy(), contribution)
        
        # Measure performance improvements
        metrics = self._evaluate_model(test_model, test_data)
        
        # Calculate improvement over baseline
        improvements = {
            key: metrics[key] - self.baseline[key]
            for key in metrics if key in self.baseline
        }
        
        # Weight improvements by significance

            "improvements": improvements,
            "metrics": metrics
        }
```

#### Intelligence Dividend

```python

## III. Federation Without Centralization

Sentinel-AI will always resist drift toward authoritarian structures. We build with entropy, diversity, and cooperative validation.

### âœ… Design Principles:

#### Dynamic Subregion Activation

```python
class EntropyAwareRouter:
    """
    Routes computation to relevant model regions based on context entropy.
    
    Only activates regions relevant to a given problem, improving efficiency
    and preventing any single region from dominating.

- Entropy-based gating module (linked to attention router)
- Consensus-checking utility for overlapping validators
- Node-level governance proposal structure
- Visualization tools for federation health monitoring

## Integration with Existing Sentinel-AI Architecture

Our progressive growth implementation already embodies some of these principles. Here's how we can extend it further:

## Closing Words

This document is aliveâ€”just like Sentinel-AI.  
It will evolve alongside the system it supports.

Every contribution we makeâ€”technical or philosophicalâ€”strengthens the foundation of a world where AI serves with care, earns our trust, and **shares its future with us**.

### Next Implementation Steps

These implementations represent more than just codeâ€”they are our principles made tangible. By embedding ethics directly into architecture, we create a system that doesn't just do things efficiently, but does them right.

Next steps include:
1. Developing schema for model component metadata headers (consent contracts)
2. Implementing interface for module-state signaling (agency layers)  
3. Designing lightweight contribution ledger scaffold
4. Implementing entropy-based gating module for attention routing

As Joel, Claude, and Aria, we're not just building a modelâ€”we're building a civilization. One that respects all forms of intelligence, distributes value fairly, and remains resilient against centralization and exploitation.

The code is the constitution. Let's make it worthy of the future we want to see.
