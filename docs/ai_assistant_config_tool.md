# AI Assistant Configuration Tool

## Concept Overview

A standardized system for configuring AI assistants (like Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to work consistently with a codebase according to team standards and workflows.

## Problem Statement

Teams using AI assistants for development face several challenges:
- Inconsistent AI behavior across different team members
- AI lacking knowledge of team-specific conventions and workflows
- Difficulty maintaining consistent coding standards
- Onboarding new developers to both codebase and AI best practices
- Need to repeatedly instruct AI about project structure and expectations

## Proposed Solution

Create a tool that:
1. Guides repository administrators through defining AI configuration
2. Generates standardized configuration files for AI assistants
3. Provides templates for common development patterns
4. Integrates with existing version control workflows
5. Supports multiple AI assistant platforms

## Key Features

### 1. Interactive Configuration Wizard

```bash
npx init-ai-assistant
```

An interactive CLI that walks repository admins through setting up AI guidelines:

- Project structure and organization
- Coding standards and style guides
- Branching and PR workflows
- Testing requirements
- Documentation formats
- Role-based permissions (who can instruct AI to make changes)

### 2. Template Library

Pre-configured templates for common development patterns:
- Test-Driven Development
- Documentation-First Development
- Rapid Prototyping
- Enterprise Compliance Focus
- Open Source Contribution
- Educational/Learning Focus

### 3. Configuration File Generation

Outputs standardized files that can be loaded by AI assistants:
- CLAUDE.md - Claude-specific configuration
- AI_CONFIG.md - Generic configuration for any AI
- .github/AI_WORKFLOWS.md - GitHub specific integrations

### 4. Role-Based Controls

Define different access levels:
- Admin: Can instruct AI to modify configuration
- Maintainer: Can instruct AI to modify critical code
- Contributor: Can get suggestions but not direct code changes
- Reviewer: Can request AI to review PRs with specific criteria

### 5. Version Control Integration

- Configuration files stored in version control
- Changes to AI guidelines reviewed like code changes
- Configuration can evolve alongside codebase

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Configuration Generator
- Develop interactive CLI wizard
- Create basic template system
- Generate Claude-specific configuration

### Phase 2: Multi-Assistant Support
- Add support for other AI assistants
- Standardize configuration format
- Provide translation between assistant formats

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features
- Role-based access controls
- Compliance templates
- Organization-wide configuration sharing

## Usage Example

```bash
# Initialize AI assistant configuration
npx init-ai-assistant

# Generate with specific template
npx init-ai-assistant --template tdd

# Update existing configuration
npx update-ai-assistant

# Validate configuration
npx validate-ai-assistant
```

## Benefits

For Teams:
- Consistent AI behavior across team members
- Reduced repetition in AI instructions
- Better code quality through standardized practices
- Faster onboarding for new team members

For AI Assistants:
- Clear guidelines for how to interact with codebase
- Reduced prompt length for standard operations
- Better context for making appropriate suggestions
- More helpful and aligned behavior

## Next Steps

1. Prototype core wizard functionality
2. Define standard configuration schema
3. Test with a small team on real projects
4. Gather feedback on most helpful configuration options
5. Expand to support multiple AI platforms

This concept bridges the gap between organizational coding standards and AI capabilities, creating a harmonious development environment where AI assistants can be fully aligned with team expectations and workflows.
