# Neural Plasticity System: Validation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive validation plan for Sentinel-AI's neural plasticity system. Our goal is to rigorously test the claims that:

1. The system can effectively adapt its structure through pruning and recovery
2. RL-based controllers can learn effective pruning strategies and ratios
3. Function preservation can be maintained despite structural changes
4. The approach generalizes across different model architectures and tasks

We will apply strict scientific methodology to avoid common pitfalls in ML research such as cherry-picking results, confounding variables, and overinterpreting patterns in noise.

## Experimental Design

### Models

| Model | Size | Architecture | Purpose |
|-------|------|--------------|---------|
| `distilgpt2` | 82M | GPT-2 | Primary validation model |
| `gpt2` | 124M | GPT-2 | Scaling validation |
| `EleutherAI/pythia-70m` | 70M | GPT-NeoX | Cross-architecture validation |
| `facebook/opt-125m` | 125M | OPT | Cross-architecture validation |

### Baseline Methods

| Method | Description | Implementation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `random` | Random pruning with fixed ratio | `RandomPruningStrategy` |
| `magnitude` | Magnitude-based pruning (fixed ratio) | `MagnitudePruningStrategy` |
| `entropy` | Entropy-based pruning (fixed ratio) | `EntropyPruningStrategy` |
| `adaptive` (ours) | RL-controlled adaptive pruning | `RLController` |

### Tasks and Metrics

#### Primary Tasks

1. **Language Modeling**
   - **Metrics**: Perplexity, loss
   - **Datasets**: WikiText-2, Penn Treebank
   - **Evaluation**: Test set perplexity after pruning and recovery

2. **Text Generation Quality**
   - **Metrics**: MAUVE score, n-gram diversity
   - **Prompts**: 20 standardized prompts from different domains
   - **Evaluation**: Quality of generated completions

3. **Transfer Task: Classification**
   - **Metrics**: Accuracy, F1 score
   - **Datasets**: SST-2 (sentiment), AG News (topic)
   - **Evaluation**: Zero-shot and few-shot performance

#### Secondary Tasks

1. **Recovery Efficiency**
   - **Metrics**: Recovery rate, steps to recovery
   - **Evaluation**: How quickly models return to baseline performance

2. **Function Preservation**
   - **Metrics**: Function preservation score, output similarity
   - **Evaluation**: Consistency of internal representations and outputs

3. **Structural Adaptation**
   - **Metrics**: Attention pattern similarity, activation pattern distances
   - **Evaluation**: How structure evolves under different stressors

### Experimental Protocol

#### Experiment A: Single-Cycle Pruning and Recovery

1. Establish baseline performance on all metrics
2. Apply each pruning method at multiple ratios (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5)
3. Measure post-pruning performance
4. Fine-tune for recovery (fixed steps)
5. Measure post-recovery performance
6. Calculate recovery rate and function preservation

#### Experiment B: Multi-Cycle Plasticity

1. Run 5 complete plasticity cycles
2. Track metrics across all cycles
3. Measure cumulative effects of repeated pruning and recovery
4. Analyze entropy patterns and function preservation over time

#### Experiment C: Task Alternation Stress Test

1. Alternate between language modeling and classification tasks
2. Apply pruning between task switches
3. Measure adaptation to task changes
4. Compare RL controller vs fixed strategies

#### Experiment D: Cross-Architecture Validation

1. Apply best methods from Experiments A-C to all model architectures
2. Analyze architecture-specific behaviors and limitations
3. Identify common patterns in plasticity across architectures

### Control Variables

To ensure fair comparison:

1. **Randomness**: Run each experiment with 5 different random seeds
2. **Computation**: Standardize fine-tuning steps across methods
3. **Data**: Use identical datasets and evaluation splits
4. **Hardware**: Run on consistent hardware configurations

## Statistical Analysis

### Hypothesis Testing

For each comparison between our method and baselines:

1. Formulate null hypothesis (H₀: no significant difference)
2. Run Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (non-parametric) or paired t-tests (if normality assumptions hold)
3. Report p-values with appropriate corrections for multiple comparisons
4. Include confidence intervals for all key metrics

### Effect Size

Beyond statistical significance, we will report:

1. Cohen's d effect size for differences between methods
2. Practical significance thresholds (e.g., >5% improvement in recovery rate)
3. Variance across runs to assess consistency

## Validation Metrics

### Primary Validation Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target | Baseline Comparison |
|--------|---------|--------|---------------------|
| Recovery Rate | (Post-pruning Loss - Post-recovery Loss) / (Post-pruning Loss - Baseline Loss) | >0.8 | >10% over best baseline |
| Function Preservation | Cosine similarity between original and recovered outputs | >0.9 | >5% over best baseline |
| Adaptation Consistency | Standard deviation of recovery rates across seeds | <0.05 | <50% of baseline variance |
| Policy Stability | Entropy of action selection distribution | Decreasing over time | N/A |
| Plasticity Quotient | Recovery Rate × (1 / Steps to Recovery) | Maximize | >15% over best baseline |

### Secondary Validation Metrics

1. **Computational Efficiency**
   - Time per cycle
   - Memory usage

2. **Generalization**
   - Performance on held-out tasks
   - Zero-shot transfer capabilities

3. **Interpretability**
   - Explainability of controller decisions
   - Correlation between pruning patterns and task requirements

## Expected Outcomes and Acceptance Criteria

For our system to be considered validated:

1. The RL controller must outperform all baseline methods on at least 3/5 primary metrics
2. Improvements must be statistically significant (p < 0.05) with meaningful effect sizes
3. Results must be consistent across at least 3/4 model architectures
4. The system must show clear learning behavior (not random exploration)
5. Performance should not degrade over multiple cycles

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Overfitting to specific datasets | Test on diverse datasets from different domains |
| Conflating recovery with retraining | Include retraining-only baselines |
| Architecture-specific behaviors | Test across multiple model families |
| Misleading aggregate metrics | Report detailed breakdowns by layer, head, and task |
| Computational constraints | Start with small models, scale up methodically |

## Documentation and Reproducibility

All experiments will include:

1. Complete code and configuration files
2. Detailed logs of all training runs
3. Raw data from all experiments
4. Statistical analysis scripts
5. Clear instructions for reproducing all results
