# Entropy Calculation Fix

## Problem
The original entropy calculation in NeuralPlasticityDemo.ipynb was producing zero values for all attention heads, making the entropy-based visualizations and metrics useless. This happened because:

1. Attention patterns with very concentrated values (near-1.0 in one position, near-0.0 elsewhere) caused numerical issues
2. The normalization and log calculations weren't properly handling edge cases
3. Lack of numerical stability safeguards created log(0) errors

## Solution
The improved entropy calculation function adds several numerical stability enhancements:

```python
def improved_entropy_calculation(attention_pattern):
    # Add small epsilon to avoid numerical issues with log(0)
    epsilon = 1e-8
    
    # Ensure attention is positive
    attention_pattern = attention_pattern.clamp(min=epsilon)
    
    # Normalize along sequence dimension to ensure it sums to 1
    norm_attention = attention_pattern / attention_pattern.sum(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
    
    # Calculate entropy: -sum(p * log(p))
    log_probs = torch.log(norm_attention)
    entropy = -torch.sum(norm_attention * log_probs, dim=-1)
    
    return entropy
```

Key improvements:
1. Added a small epsilon to prevent zero values
2. Clamped attention values to ensure positivity
3. Proper normalization to ensure valid probability distributions
4. Direct calculation of log values without custom masking

## Results
The fix successfully produces non-zero entropy values for all attention patterns, allowing effective visualization and analysis of attention head behaviors.

## Implementation
The fix has been applied to the NeuralPlasticityDemo.ipynb by:
1. Adding the improved entropy calculation function
2. Patching the controller's entropy calculation method
3. Updating version history and changelog
