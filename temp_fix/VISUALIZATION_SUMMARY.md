# Neural Plasticity Visualization Refactoring

## Summary

We've successfully refactored the visualization code from the NeuralPlasticityDemo notebook into a proper utility module. This improves code quality, maintainability, and testability while making the visualization functions more reusable across the project.

## Accomplishments

1. **Created Visualization Utility Module**
   - Implemented `visualization_additions.py` with specialized visualization functions
   - Added proper type hints, docstrings, and error handling
   - Made functions compatible with both torch.Tensor and numpy.ndarray inputs
   - Ensured consistent interfaces and behavior

2. **Created Testing Infrastructure**
   - Implemented `test_visualization_utils.py` to test the visualization functions
   - Added tests for various input types and edge cases
   - Made tests work even when dependencies aren't available (CI-friendly)

3. **Prepared Notebook Update Script**
   - Created `update_notebook_to_use_utility_viz.py` to update the notebook
   - Added logic to replace inline function definitions with imports
   - Implemented version incrementing and changelog updates
   - Added dry-run option for testing without making changes

4. **Added Documentation**
   - Created `visualization_README.md` with usage examples and documentation
   - Added README_VISUALIZATION_UPDATE.md to document the refactoring process
   - Added comprehensive docstrings to all functions
   - Created usage examples for each visualization function

## Key Functions Refactored

1. `visualize_gradient_norms()`: Show gradient norms with markers for pruned/revived heads
2. `visualize_attention_matrix()`: Visualize attention patterns for specific layers/heads
3. `visualize_entropy_heatmap()`: Display entropy values across layers and heads
4. `visualize_normalized_entropy()`: Show entropy as percentage of maximum possible
5. `visualize_entropy_vs_gradient()`: Create scatter plot of entropy vs gradient values
6. `visualize_training_progress()`: Show training metrics including loss, pruning and sparsity

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. **Run the notebook update script** to modify the NeuralPlasticityDemo.ipynb:
   ```bash
   python temp_fix/update_notebook_to_use_utility_viz.py
   ```

2. **Test the updated notebook** to ensure it works with the new utility functions:
   - Run the notebook in Colab to verify visualization functions work correctly
   - Verify notebook runs without errors in both CPU and GPU environments

3. **Commit changes** after successful testing:
   ```bash
   git add utils/pruning/visualization_additions.py
   git add utils/pruning/visualization_README.md
   git add temp_fix/test_visualization_utils.py
   git add temp_fix/update_notebook_to_use_utility_viz.py
   git add colab_notebooks/NeuralPlasticityDemo.ipynb
   git commit -m "Refactor visualization code into utility module
   
   - Extract visualization functions to utils/pruning/visualization_additions.py
   - Add tests and documentation for visualization utilities
   - Update NeuralPlasticityDemo.ipynb to use imported functions
   - Improve code quality with proper typing and error handling"
   ```

## Benefits

This refactoring provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Fixes can be made in one place and benefit all uses
2. **Better Testability**: Functions can be tested independently of the notebook
3. **Enhanced Reusability**: Functions can be used in other notebooks/scripts
4. **Cleaner Notebook**: Notebook has less boilerplate code, focusing on demonstration
5. **Better Documentation**: Proper docstrings and README make functions easier to use
