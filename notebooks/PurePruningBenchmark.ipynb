    "# Pure Pruning Benchmark - Sentinel AI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an interactive interface for running the pure pruning benchmark in Google Colab. The benchmark evaluates the efficiency benefits of pruning in isolation from agency features, providing a rigorous demonstration that our pruning approach creates genuine efficiency improvements beyond simple quantization effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comprehensive evaluation**: Measures efficiency metrics like FLOPs, memory usage, and latency\n",
    "- **Multiple pruning strategies**: Tests gradual, one-shot, and iterative pruning approaches\n",
    "- **Different pruning methods**: Compares entropy-based, random, and magnitude-based pruning\n",
    "- **Training integration**: Includes proper fine-tuning phases after pruning\n",
    "- **Output quality measurement**: Evaluates perplexity, diversity, and repetition metrics\n",
    "- **Google Drive integration**: Save results to your Google Drive for persistence"
