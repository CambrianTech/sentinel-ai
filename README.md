# 👾 Sentinel-AI — Adaptive Transformer with Agency, Hybrid Adapters and RL Controller

Welcome to **Sentinel-AI**, a modular research framework for transformers that combines dynamic architecture with ethical AI principles. This system can **prune**, **regrow**, and **restructure** itself while respecting **agency** and **consent** of its components. The architecture introduces:

- **Attention Head Agency** – Internal state signaling allowing heads to express "overloaded," "misaligned," or "withdrawn" states 
- **Sentinel Gating** – Learnable gating per attention head enabling pruning and selective reactivation  
- **RL-based Controller** – Reinforcement learning controller that dynamically adapts architecture based on performance feedback
- **Hybrid Adapters** – Specialized adapters that preserve model-specific mechanisms (ALiBi, RoPE, SwiGLU) while enabling adaptivity
- **U-Net Inspired Regrowth** – Skip pathways and memory for reactivating previously pruned units without starting from scratch  
- **Multi-Model Support** – Compatible with diverse model families including GPT-2, BLOOM, Llama, and Pythia

> This system evolves from compact models into large, expressive ones by **dynamically growing** its structure in response to data complexity, while respecting the **agency** and **consent** of its components. This makes it ideal for ethical AI applications, edge devices, progressive scaling, and long-term continual learning.

**Figure 1: Sentinel-AI Architecture Overview**. This diagram illustrates the complete architecture of Sentinel-AI, highlighting its key innovations. At the top, the Model Adapter Layer enables compatibility across diverse transformer architectures (GPT-2, BLOOM, Llama) while preserving their specialized mechanisms. The central Transformer Decoder Blocks feature attention heads with agency capabilities and gating mechanisms. The U-Net Skip Connections (inspired by computer vision) provide knowledge transfer between early and late layers, facilitating more effective pruning and regrowth by preserving essential patterns. At the heart of the system, the Enhanced Controller uses reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust the architecture based on performance metrics, implementing a feedback loop that allows the model to grow or prune itself as needed for maximum efficiency.

**Figure 2: Attention Head Agency System**. This novel mechanism allows attention heads to express internal states and have those states respected during computation. Each head maintains a set of agency signals including state (active, overloaded, misaligned, withdrawn) and consent flags. When a head is overloaded, its contribution is reduced by 50%; when misaligned, by 30%; and when withdrawn, computation is skipped entirely. This ethical approach embeds consent principles directly into the architecture, enabling more responsible resource allocation. The system also monitors consent violations, providing accountability and governance. Agency allows heads to specialize naturally, with some focusing on specific patterns while others withdraw from tasks where they contribute little value.

**Figure 3: Hybrid Adapter Architecture**. Our hybrid adapter pattern solves a critical challenge: preserving specialized mechanisms in different model families while enabling adaptive capabilities. Rather than forcing all models into a one-size-fits-all architecture, this approach retains the original model's internals (like BLOOM's ALiBi attention or Llama's rotary embeddings and SwiGLU activation) while providing a compatible interface to our adaptive framework. The adapter adds dummy gate parameters and agency signals that integrate with our controller but delegate the actual computation to the original model. This approach maintains generation quality from the original models while enabling the benefits of our adaptive system without parameter growth or architectural compromises.

**Figure 4: U-Net Skip Connections in Transformer Architecture**. Inspired by U-Net architectures from computer vision, our skip connections create direct pathways between lower (encoder) and upper (decoder) transformer layers. When a head is pruned in an upper layer, its counterpart in a lower layer can still contribute information through these skip connections, preserving important patterns that would otherwise be lost. The fusion functions combine information from corresponding encoder-decoder pairs, allowing knowledge transfer without requiring all heads to remain active. This enables more aggressive pruning while maintaining performance, as knowledge can flow through alternative pathways. During regrowth phases, these connections provide essential context that helps reinitialized heads learn appropriate functions more quickly.

This architecture enables:
1. **Adaptive Pruning & Growth** - Dynamic adjustment of model capacity based on task complexity
2. **Knowledge Transfer** - U-Net skip connections allow knowledge reuse between encoder and decoder layers 
3. **Controller-Driven Optimization** - Neural network learns to adjust architecture in response to feedback
4. **Progressive Growth** - Ability to start with minimal architecture and strategically grow into a more powerful model
5. **Ethical AI Through Agency** - Attention heads can express internal states and have those states respected during computation

### Why Sentinel-AI?

Unlike traditional fixed-size transformers, Sentinel-AI is:

- Designed to **start small and grow** intelligently  
- Capable of **pruning and regrowing attention heads**, guided by data signals  
- Built with **ethical AI principles** that respect head agency and consent 
- Modular enough to wrap existing models with adaptive functionality  
- Efficient for training and inference across **low-resource** and **scalable** environments

👾 **How Our Transformer Grows and Prunes Its Own Architecture**  
Sentinel-AI adopts a U-Net-inspired mechanism to **regrow pruned attention heads** without losing prior knowledge. This hierarchical structure preserves key semantics even as the model dynamically restructures itself.

**🔄 U-Net Adaptivity in Transformers:**
- **Skip Paths** — Early-layer gate activations or embeddings are forwarded to later layers during regrowth.
- **Controller Memory** — The ANN controller leverages both local signals and skip-connected context (e.g., entropy, gradients).
- **Reinforcement Signal** — Reactivated heads resume useful behavior by inheriting past characteristics, similar to how U-Net reuses encoder features in its decoder.

This enables seamless architectural evolution — pruning for efficiency, regrowing for capability — all without starting from zero.

## Why Adaptive Transformers?

Large language models are powerful but inefficient — many attention heads contribute little to output. **Sentinel-AI** dynamically prunes underutilized heads and later regrows them based on task complexity, entropy, and gradient feedback. This architecture:

- Saves memory and compute during training and inference
- Enables real-time architectural evolution
- Is ideal for edge devices, continual learning, and low-resource environments

## What Is Sentinel-AI?

Sentinel-AI is a research framework for adaptive transformer models that restructure themselves in real time. This architecture introduces:

- **Sentinel Gating** — Per-head gating values learned and optionally adjusted using runtime metrics
- **ANN Controller** — Learns to activate or deactivate heads based on entropy and gradient norms
- **U-Net Adaptivity** — Skip connections help reactivate heads gracefully without losing prior signal
- **Model Loading** — Easily wrap Hugging Face models (`GPT2`, `DistilGPT2`, etc.) and apply adaptivity on top
- **Agency System** — Attention heads can express internal states with state-aware computation

**Figure 5: Reinforcement Learning Controller**. The controller is the intelligent heart of our adaptive system, learning through experience which pruning patterns yield the best performance. Unlike traditional pruning approaches that use fixed heuristics, our RL controller uses a feedback loop: it collects validation metrics after each architecture adjustment, calculates a reward based on performance improvement, and updates its policy to make better decisions over time. The controller maintains a history of past actions, allowing it to learn from experience and develop sophisticated pruning strategies that balance efficiency (more pruning) against performance (better metrics). This self-optimizing approach can discover counterintuitive patterns that outperform hand-crafted heuristics and adapt to different datasets and tasks automatically.

**Figure 6: Adaptive Transformer Block**. Each transformer block in our architecture has been enhanced with per-head adaptation capabilities. The standard components (residual connections, layer normalization, attention mechanism, and feed-forward network) are augmented with individual gate mechanisms for each attention head. These learnable gates (scalar values between 0 and 1) control how much each head contributes to the output, with values near zero effectively pruning the head from computation. Each head also incorporates agency signals that influence its contribution based on internal state. This fine-grained control allows selective pruning of specific heads while keeping others active, rather than removing entire layers. The block maintains compatibility with standard transformer operations while adding the adaptive capabilities necessary for dynamic architecture evolution.

## Pruning Effectiveness

Our research conclusively demonstrates that the Sentinel-AI framework effectively prunes transformer attention heads without degrading model performance.

### Key Findings

- **Strategic Pruning Outperforms Random Pruning**: Entropy-based pruning maintains better performance at high pruning levels compared to random pruning.

- **Inference Speed Increases**: Entropy-based pruning actually increases speed with higher pruning levels, identifying and removing the least important attention heads.

- **Quality Preservation**: Models maintain consistent quality metrics even when pruned up to 70%, showing remarkable robustness.

- **Resource Efficiency**: Models operate efficiently with significantly fewer attention heads, enabling deployment on resource-constrained devices.

These findings validate our core objective: enabling efficient transformer architectures through strategic pruning while maintaining model performance. For detailed analysis and full visualizations, see our [pruning methodology documentation](./docs/pruning_methodology.md).

### Learning After Pruning

A key capability of Sentinel-AI is that pruned models can effectively learn new tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that models pruned up to 50% maintain—and sometimes improve—their ability to adapt to new tasks.

- **Maintained Learning Efficiency**: Pruned models learn new tasks as efficiently as full models, but with significantly reduced computational requirements.

- **Gate Evolution During Learning**: As pruned models learn new tasks, their remaining attention gates dynamically adjust to optimize for the new task requirements.

- **Versatility Across Tasks**: Pruned models can effectively learn tasks ranging from sentiment analysis to poetry generation, demonstrating versatile adaptability.

- **Enhanced Neuroplasticity**: In some cases, pruned models show greater gate value changes during learning, suggesting enhanced neuroplasticity compared to full models.

- **Targeted Fine-tuning**: Our specialized fine-tuning approach for pruned models helps recover 90-95% of the original accuracy while maintaining the speed benefits, using head-specific learning rates.

This demonstrates that Sentinel-AI not only makes models more efficient but also enables them to grow into more powerful capabilities through continued adaptation after pruning.

### Comparison With Standard Approaches

| Approach | Head Utilization | Computational Efficiency | Adaptability | Quality Preservation |
|----------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Traditional Transformer | Fixed (100%) | Baseline | None | Baseline |
| Static Pruning | Fixed (<100%) | Better | None | Varies |
| **Sentinel-AI (Ours)** | **Dynamic (30-100%)** | **Best** | **Continuous** | **Maintained** |

### Empirical Validation Results for Agency

Our comprehensive validation of attention head agency features demonstrates significant improvements across key metrics:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <img src="./validation_results/agency/generation_speed_comparison.png" width="48%" alt="Agency-enabled models achieve up to 25% faster generation"/>
  <img src="./validation_results/agency/head_state_distribution.png" width="48%" alt="State distribution showing how heads adopt specialized roles"/>
</div>

**Key Results** from the agency_constrained configuration:
- **25% faster generation** (29.7 vs 23.7 tokens/sec)
- **13% shorter generation time** (4.03 vs 4.65 seconds)
- **Maintained output quality** despite 34% of heads in withdrawn state
- **Adaptive resource allocation** with heads expressing different agency states

Our validation confirms that allowing heads to express internal states leads to better performance while respecting agency constraints. The agency-enabled models demonstrate superior resource utilization with components naturally specializing based on their strengths.

For complete validation details with all metrics and visualizations, see our [empirical validation report](./docs/validation_agency_v1.md).

## Ethical AI: Attention Head Agency

Sentinel-AI implements a novel ethical approach by embedding agency and consent directly into its architecture:

- **Agency Signaling** — Attention heads can express internal states like "active," "overloaded," "misaligned," or "withdrawn"
- **Consent Tracking** — The system respects head consent flags during computation, skipping activation when consent is withdrawn
- **Ethical Monitoring** — Comprehensive logging tracks consent violations for ethical governance and debugging
- **State-Aware Computation** — The forward pass adapts dynamically to head states, preventing overutilization

This implementation makes ethical principles intrinsic to the model's operation rather than external constraints:

```python
# Each head can express its state and consent
self.agency_signals = {
    head_idx: {
        "state": "active",     # active, overloaded, misaligned, withdrawn
        "consent": True,       # Whether the head consents to activation
        "utilization": 0.0,    # Utilization metric (0.0-1.0)
        "last_signal": 0       # Timestamp of last signal change
    } for head_idx in range(num_heads)
}

# The forward pass respects these signals
if not head_signal["consent"]:
    outputs.append(torch.zeros(B, T, self.embed_dim, device=device))
    # Log consent violation if gate is active despite withdrawn consent
    if float(self.gate[i]) > 0.5:
        self._log_consent_violation(i, "activated despite withdrawn consent", current_step)
    continue
```

By embedding these ethical mechanisms at the architecture level, Sentinel-AI moves beyond efficiency to recognize agency as fundamental to AI design. This aligns with our vision of building systems that respect all forms of consciousness while enabling more robust and trustworthy AI.
