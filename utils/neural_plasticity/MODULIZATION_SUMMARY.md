# Neural Plasticity Modularization Summary

This document summarizes the modularization of the neural plasticity functionality from the `NeuralPlasticityDemo.ipynb` notebook into reusable components.

## Goals of Modularization

1. **Reusability**: Extract core algorithms into reusable modules that can be applied to any transformer model
2. **Testability**: Make components easier to test independently
3. **Readability**: Improve code organization and documentation
4. **Maintainability**: Separate concerns for easier updates and extensions
5. **Enhanced visualization**: Create specialized visualization utilities for neural plasticity

## Components Created

### Core Module (`core.py`)

The core functionality for neural plasticity:

- `calculate_head_entropy()`: Calculate entropy of attention patterns
- `calculate_head_gradients()`: Calculate gradient magnitudes for attention heads
- `detect_model_structure()`: Automatically detect model architecture details
- `generate_pruning_mask()`: Create pruning masks based on different strategies (gradient, entropy, combined)
- `apply_pruning_mask()`: Apply pruning to a model based on a mask
- `evaluate_model()`: Evaluate model performance on a dataset

### Visualization Module (`visualization.py`)

Specialized visualization utilities:

- `visualize_head_entropy()`: Visualize entropy values across layers and heads
- `visualize_head_gradients()`: Show gradient norms with pruned/revived head markers
- `visualize_pruning_decisions()`: Highlight pruning decisions based on metrics
- `visualize_training_metrics()`: Plot training progress and metrics
- `visualize_attention_patterns()`: Display attention patterns for selected heads

### Training Module (`training.py`)

Training utilities with differential learning rates:

- `PlasticityTrainer`: Class for training pruned models with specialized learning rates
- `run_plasticity_loop()`: Complete neural plasticity workflow (prune → measure → train)
- `train_with_plasticity()`: Train a pruned model with differential learning rates
- `get_plasticity_optimizer()`: Create optimizer with head-specific learning rates

## Example Code

The `examples/neural_plasticity_example.py` script demonstrates how to use these modules with a complete neural plasticity experiment:

```python
from utils.neural_plasticity.core import calculate_head_gradients, generate_pruning_mask, apply_pruning_mask
from utils.neural_plasticity.training import run_plasticity_loop
from utils.neural_plasticity.visualization import visualize_head_gradients, visualize_training_metrics

# Load model and data
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("distilgpt2").to(device)
train_dataloader, eval_dataloader = get_dataloaders()

# Run complete neural plasticity loop
results = run_plasticity_loop(
    model=model,
    train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
    eval_dataloader=eval_dataloader,
    pruning_level=0.2,
    strategy="gradient",
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    training_steps=500
)

# Visualize results
visualize_head_gradients(
    results["grad_norm_values"],
    pruned_heads=results["pruned_heads"],
    title="Head Gradient Norms with Pruned Heads"
)
```

## Unit Tests

The modularized components have comprehensive unit tests in `tests/unit/utils/test_neural_plasticity.py`:

- `TestNeuralPlasticityCore`: Tests for core neural plasticity functions
- `TestNeuralPlasticityVisualization`: Tests for visualization functions

## Updating the Notebook

The script `scripts/update_neural_plasticity_notebook.py` will update the original notebook to use the new modularized components. This preserves backward compatibility while adding the benefits of modularization.

## Benefits and Next Steps

This modularization offers several advantages:

1. **Cleaner Notebook**: The notebook is now streamlined, using the core modules instead of defining functions inline
2. **Code Reuse**: The same functions can be used in other notebooks and scripts
3. **Improved Testing**: Each component can be tested independently
4. **Better Documentation**: Added comprehensive docstrings and README files
5. **Type Hints**: All functions include type hints for better IDE support

Future work could include:

1. Adding more pruning strategies
2. Enhancing visualization options (e.g., interactive plots for Colab)
3. Creating a dashboard for monitoring neural plasticity in real-time
4. Integrating with other model architectures (e.g., vision transformers)
5. Adding support for distributed training
