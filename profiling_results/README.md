# Profiling Results for Sentinel AI

This directory contains profiling results from various benchmarks of the Sentinel AI system, focusing on model optimization and pruning performance.

## Overview

The profiling results demonstrate the performance characteristics of the optimized transformer implementation with different pruning levels and optimization settings. We've evaluated:

1. Basic attention mechanism optimization
2. Full model inference with different pruning levels
3. Impact of different optimization levels
4. Effects of integration points (baseline and UNet connections)
5. Scaling behavior across model sizes

## Key Findings

### 1. Direct Attention Optimization

The optimized attention mechanism demonstrates significant speedups over the original implementation:
- Average speedup: ~2.2x across sequence lengths
- Best improvement at sequence length 64: 2.75x speedup
- Consistent improvements across all tested sequence lengths (32-512)

### 2. Pruning Performance

Pruning shows clear performance benefits for both original and optimized models:
- 50% pruning provides the optimal balance of speed vs. quality
- At 50% pruning, the optimized model achieves ~22.2 tokens/second vs ~22.5 for the original
- The optimized model's performance advantage increases with pruning level up to 50% 
- Beyond 70% pruning, quality likely degrades significantly

### 3. Optimization Levels

We tested different optimization levels (1-3) with consistent findings:
- Level 2 optimization provides the best performance at 50% pruning (23.4 tokens/sec)
- Level 1 (default) is better for unpruned models
- Level 3 (extreme) doesn't provide additional benefits and sometimes decreases performance

### 4. Integration Points

Investigation of integration features (baseline model integration and UNet connections):
- Full optimization with all integrations performs best at 0% pruning (15.5 tokens/sec)
- At higher pruning levels (50%), the baseline integration becomes a bottleneck
- Removing the baseline integration improves performance at 50% pruning to 19.8 tokens/sec
- UNet connections have less impact on performance than baseline integration

### 5. Model Scaling

Performance comparisons across model sizes:
- Parameter growth is consistent across models (~11-14%)
- GPT2 (small): 19 tokens/sec
- GPT2-medium: 5.7 tokens/sec
- Larger models show more performance benefit from pruning

## Recommendations

Based on the profiling results, we recommend:

1. **Default Configuration**: Use optimization level 2 with 50% pruning for most workloads
2. **Low Latency Needs**: Disable baseline integration for higher pruning levels (>30%)
3. **Quality Focus**: Use optimization level 1 with 30% pruning for a balance of speed and quality
4. **Memory Constraints**: Higher pruning levels (50-70%) significantly reduce memory usage with acceptable quality

## Next Steps

Future profiling work should focus on:
1. More extensive quality evaluations at different pruning levels
2. Performance analysis on GPU/TPU accelerators
3. Component-level timing with CUDA profiling
4. Memory usage optimizations for large models
